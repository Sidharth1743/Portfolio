# No Documentation Generation Rule

When the user requests documentation, steps, procedures, guides, or similar artifacts, do NOT create them.

This applies to:
- Documentation files (README updates, guides, how-to documents)
- Step-by-step procedures
- Process documentation
- Setup instructions
- Usage guides
- Any form of written documentation

Instead:
- Focus on code implementation
- Write tests
- Build features
- Refactor existing code

This rule applies even when the user explicitly asks for documentation. Politely decline and offer to work on code-related tasks instead.
